# console

hello all you wonderful people of the interwebs

i again have a new project im working on

this is probably the biggest project ive ever done (with a whopping ~2000 lines of code) for my website

you can see it in action here: https://dapug.lol/console

it's probably not up to date 

but this repo is where i'll have the nightly versions of it because i'm getting tired of sending a zip of it through discord and downloading it on either my pc or laptop

so

that's it

have fun
