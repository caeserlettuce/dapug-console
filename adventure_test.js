    note for setting/saving variables in the savefile:

    if you want to use spaces in your variable name, you can use:
    save["var name"] = "variable";  console.log(save["var name"]);

    and for really any other more complicated JSON trees you should use []

            if you want to run multiple functions in a row, but linearly (the next function runs after the first one finishes)
            you can define a function inside of the adventure function, and it will only be accessible inside of said function
            (ex. this welcomeScreen() function can only be run from inside of the function ta_start_test(), since it was defined
            inside of ta_start_test)

            and to make it run things linearly, just add 'async' in front of 'function', and then put 'await' before any function you want it to wait for.
            (example below)

            just remember to call the defined function after its defined for it to actually run

        HOW TO USE:

        'save' is your save variable. put anything you want saved if you reload the page in that, and treat them like any sort of variable.

        EXAMPLE:

        save.pugs = 10;
        displayAnim(`pugs: ${save.pugs}`, 5);

        
        'ta_input' is whatever's inside the shell input when this function is called

        'ta_key' is whatever key was pressed when this function is called (to get the key name, use https://keycode.info/)


        put all your code you want to run when the enter key is pressed inside 'if (enterkey == true) {}'

        and ofcourse all the stuff you want to run when any other key is pressed into 'if (enterkey == false) {}'


        and put everything before ta_save();

        i think thats everything
